3) Visual brand system (colors, typography, imagery)
Color palette (use in Tailwind theme)

Primary deep teal / trust tone — #0B5563 (use for primary CTAs, nav)

Accent warm orange — #FF8A3D (use sparingly for CTA accents, highlights)

Growth green — #2D9A6A (use for success badges, positive metrics)

Neutral dark — #1F2937 (text)

Light background — #F7FAFC

Muted card background — #FFFFFF with subtle shadow

Usage rules

Primary CTA: background #0B5563, white text.

Secondary CTA: outlined with #0B5563 or solid #FF8A3D.

Use #2D9A6A for success and “results” numbers.

Keep > 4.5:1 contrast for body text on backgrounds.

Typography (Google Fonts)

Headings: Poppins (or Montserrat) — bold, geometric

Body: Inter — readable UI font

Accent/Serif for lead quotes or hero tagline: Merriweather (optional)

Example font stack:

font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial;
heading-family: 'Poppins', 'Inter', system-ui;

Imagery

Real photos of Kenyan brick & mortar shops, markets, salons, small factories. Use authentic images (no stocky, generic “corporate” photos).

Use close-up shots showing people, point-of-sale interactions, shelves, hands-on work — creates empathy and relatability.

Overlay semi-transparent brand color on images for consistency when used as hero backgrounds.

Iconography

Use Heroicons or Lucide (SVG icons). Keep stroke icons rather than heavy fills.

Use simple, consistent icon style for features and benefits.

4) Layout & responsive grid

Base container widths:

max-width: 1200px for main content (desktop)

24px horizontal padding mobile

Grid: 12-column layout (desktop). Use 1–2 columns for hero, 3 or 4 columns for feature cards on desktop, stack vertically on mobile.

Spacing scale: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 (Tailwind: p-4, p-8, p-16...)

Breakpoints:

sm 640px — mobile

md 768px — tablet

lg 1024px — small desktop

xl 1280px — large desktop

5) Page-by-page structure with content blocks & copy suggestions
HOME (goal: immediate clarity + primary CTA)

7) Example Helpfulabs Framework (brandable)

Name it and use everywhere: Helpfulabs 3-Pillar System

Pillar 1: Discover (Audit & Systems Map)

Pillar 2: Design (SOPs, Role Clarity, Financial Flow)

Pillar 3: Deliver (Automation, Training, Owner Oversight Rhythm)

Use this framework as the backbone of all pages and packages.

8) Example React + Tailwind components (starter snippets)
1) Tailwind theme extension (tailwind.config.js)
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          DEFAULT: '#0B5563', // primary
          light: '#2B7A86',
          accent: '#FF8A3D',
          success: '#2D9A6A',
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        heading: ['Poppins', 'Inter', 'sans-serif'],
        body: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};

2) Hero component (Next.js / React)
// components/Hero.jsx
export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <section className="bg-gray-50">
      <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-16 grid lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10 items-center">
        <div>
          <h1 className="text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-heading font-bold text-brand">
            Helpfulabs Solutions
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
            Practical automation and systems for local product & service businesses — run smoother, reduce owner stress, and grow profitably.
          </p>

          <div className="mt-6 flex flex-wrap gap-3">
            <a href="/health-check" className="inline-block bg-brand text-white px-5 py-3 rounded-md shadow">
              Take the Systems Health Check
            </a>
            <a href="/contact" className="inline-block border border-brand text-brand px-5 py-3 rounded-md">
              Book a Discovery Call
            </a>
          </div>

          <ul className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-3 text-sm text-gray-600">
            <li>Reduce stock waste</li>
            <li>Simplify finances</li>
            <li>Keep customers coming back</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="hidden lg:block">
          <div className="rounded-md overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
            <img src="/images/nairobi-shop.jpg" alt="Local shop" className="w-full h-80 object-cover" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}


(Use similar structured components for Features, Pricing, Testimonials, Footer.)

9) Accessibility & performance checklist

Make CTA buttons focusable with :focus states and aria-label where needed.

Images: use alt attributes, next/image for optimized loading.

Colors: ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text; 3:1 for larger headings.

Semantic HTML: <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer> and proper heading hierarchy.

Keyboard navigation: test tab order.

Lighthouse targets: Time to interactive < 3s on 4G, Performance score > 90.

Use rel="preload" for fonts, compress images (WebP), enable server-side rendering or static generation.

10) SEO & metadata

Each page: unique <title> and <meta description> (<=160 chars).

Use Open Graph tags for social sharing.

Implement LocalBusiness schema (JSON-LD) on site for local SEO (include address, phone, openingHours).

Blog: target local keywords + long-tail (e.g., “inventory system for Kenyan retailers”).

Create an XML sitemap and robots.txt.

Build backlinks: list on local directories, LinkedIn posts, guest posts on local business blogs.

Example JSON-LD (place in <Head>):

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ProfessionalService",
  "name": "Helpfulabs Solutions",
  "url": "https://helpfulabs.example",
  "logo": "https://helpfulabs.example/logo.png",
  "telephone": "+2547XXXXXXXX",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "Your office address",
    "addressLocality": "Nairobi",
    "addressRegion": "Kenya",
    "postalCode": "XXXXXX",
    "addressCountry": "KE"
  },
  "areaServed": "Kenya",
  "description": "Business automation and systemization for local product & service businesses."
}
</script>
