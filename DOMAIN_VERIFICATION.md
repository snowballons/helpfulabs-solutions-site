# Domain Verification Guide for Resend

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Email Integration**: Working with test domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`)  
‚è≥ **Custom Domain**: `helpfulabssolutions.com` needs verification  
üîë **API Key**: Configured and working  

## Steps to Verify Your Domain

### 1. Access Resend Dashboard
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Log in with your account

### 2. Add Your Domain
1. Click "Add Domain"
2. Enter: `helpfulabssolutions.com`
3. Click "Add Domain"

### 3. Configure DNS Records
Resend will provide DNS records to add to your domain. You'll need to add these to your DNS provider (where you manage helpfulabssolutions.com):

**Typical records you'll need to add:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: [Resend verification code]

Type: MX
Name: @
Value: [Resend MX record]
Priority: 10

Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: "v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all"

Type: CNAME
Name: rs1._domainkey
Value: [Resend DKIM record]

Type: CNAME
Name: rs2._domainkey
Value: [Resend DKIM record]
```

### 4. Wait for Verification
- DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours
- Resend will automatically verify once records are detected
- You'll receive an email confirmation when verified

### 5. Update Environment Variables
Once verified, update `.env.local`:

```env
# Change from:
FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
ADMIN_EMAIL=snowballons@protonmail.com

# To:
FROM_EMAIL=hello@helpfulabssolutions.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=hello@helpfulabssolutions.com
```
